<h1>Cryptomeetup project description</h1>
<p><strong>Cryptomeetup is the world's first decentralized events platform, which combines the game of buying land and UGC features. The project is still in the development and iteration. </strong></p>

<h3>1. Globe Module</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Players can become regional manager by buying and selling countries’ tokens, in order to manage the events associated with the region.</li>
  <li>2nd round of the game testing has already finished. Please wait for the next round and new gameplay.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Map Module</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cryptomeetup provides LBS services and now supports the UGC function which enables users to upload their own landmark!</li>
  <li>Users can login to the EOS account and create landmarks at current location by click "create the landmark" button. Users should enter correct information and  upload for peer review. Currently, the reviewing process is carried out by the core players and will gradually handover to the community，to power the development of cryptomeetup. Users will own the landmark immediately after the review.</li>
  <li>We will select correct landmarks that users uploaded to publish on the EOS blockchain.  Later, we will implement more games and gameplay based on geographic location, as well as airdrops. Stay tuned!</li>
