Cryptomeetup is a decentralized events platform powered by cutting-edge blockchain technology, which integrates decentralized games, blockchain events, and blockchain ticketing. It provides user generated content (UGC) features as a whole. Cryptomeetup is an open source project, and it opens to all the developers in the community and motivates by token economic.

Cryptomeetups currently provides globe module and map module, and integrates gameplay and openness. The future growing direction will depends on the community consensus.

Cryptomeetup is currently divided into the globe module and the map module:

In the Globe Module, we devided the land into serveral levels, such as the world, continents, countries, cities, and landmarks. And these game assets are Non-Fungible Tokens, which are unique and transparent on the blockchain. Cryptomeetup will provides different gameplay with variety levels of assets.

In the map module, users can upload their own landmarks, which are be recorded on the blockchain and turned into user's own assets. Cryptomeetup offers variety of gameplay options, giving users the greatest freedom to create; Users can freely buy and sell their own landmarks, define their attributes, hold events on own land for revenue, etc.

## Blockchain Events

Users can buy and sell land token (such as national token) to become regional manager of the area and have the right to manage activities in the area.

## Chech-in at blockchain events

Cryptomeetup launched its check in function at the [first DApp Developer Conference in Beijing](https://www.bagevent.com/event/1871915?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) on 8 ~ 9 November 2018. People who attended the conference could use EOS accounts with chrome + scatter plugin, or EOS mobile wallet such as Tokenpocket or Meet.one or Math wallet, to win the genesis badge of cryptomeetup by checking in at specific time and region. Players who had this badge can apply for free tickets of 2nd Dapp Developer Conference! 

## UGC - to upload your own landmarks

User-generated content is the most important part of the blockchain applications. Cryptomeetup allows players to use mobile wallets such as tokenpocket to create landmarks in any unclaimed locations, complete with descriptions and images. Verified landmarks will be uploaded to the EOS blockchain as an digital non-frigiable asset which is tradable and can be reuse on other LBS blockchain games.

In order to prevent users from uploading spam, we allow core cryptomeetup players to review these UGC content and will be completely open to the whole commuinty in the future.
